There are totally 4 kinds of windows avaliable in this project.
Each source code will output the window coefficients of certain type corresponding to user's inputs.
Normally, use Kaiser window (KAIS.c). It has best performance for any kinds of input.
A file named "data.txt" will be created automatically, There are the design results (window length and window coefficients)
inside. 
Copy the window coefficients to the "BandPassFilter.c" (repalce the static array) and window length to the "BandPassFilter.h"
(replace the window length).
