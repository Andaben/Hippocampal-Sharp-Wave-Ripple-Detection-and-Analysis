The head file and source code is the core of the bandpass filter algorithm.
For "BandPassFilter.h" the only flexible part is "#define BANDPASSFILTER_TAP_NUM", the number after it should be 
referred to the window length calculated by computer.
For "BandPassFilter.h" the only flexible part is "static int filter_taps", the coefficient inside should be 
referred to the window coefficients calculated by computer as well.
These two files are concluded in the main funtion of Arduino IDE project, so all the algorthm will be compiled by Arduino IDE
